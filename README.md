# üåê Web Requests Widget

A react component to make web requests from the front-end.

## About

This is a fun-project consciously ignoring the responsibility-premises of front- and backend and therefore very limited in its functionality as an all-purpose web request client.

## Limitation

As this component logic is running on the client/browser, requests can only be made to APIs which explicitly allow CORS requests. A CORS proxy (such as `cors-anywhere`) can be supplied as a parameter to allow for general web requests.

## CORS proxy

To allow for general requests, the target must either have CORS enabled explicitly or the request must be routed through a CORS proxy such as `cors-anywhere`. The `proxy` prop of this component can be supplied the host of the CORS proxy. That will route all requests through the proxy.

```jsx
<Requests proxy="http://examplecorsproxy.com/" />
```

## Demo

A live demo can be found over at [requestdemo.rauhut.me](https://requestdemo.rauhut.me/). Please note that this is solely an implementation of this ``Web Requests Widget`` without a CORS proxy, therefore you are limited in which APIs you can query. You can use it to test my [GetGuid API](https://github.com/0tii/GetGuid), though.
